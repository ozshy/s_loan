A Model of Student Loans and the Burden of Tuition

There are two R files: 

(i) s_loan_theory_2022_5_31.R which plots the model simulations depicted in Figures 4, 5, and 6. 

(ii) s_loan_empirical_2022_6_10.R which reads the .csv files and plots Figure 1 in the paper.

In addition, there are several .csv files that are called by the R-code (ii). Download and place all files into a single folder on your machine. Then, don't forget to change the "working directory" in the R-code files. 

Note: The files s_loan_2022_5_29.pdf and s_loan_2022_5_29.dfw are not related to the R-code. The PDF s_loan_2022_5_29.pdf provides all the algebraic derivations of all the equations in the paper (results, equilibrium values, and appendices). The file s_loan_2022_5_29.pdf is printed s_loan_2022_5_29.dfw which requires Derive for Windows software (symbolic algebra software).
